Description: Enables quick calibration of radiocarbon dates under various calibration curves (including user generated ones); age-depth modelling as per the algorithm of Haslett and Parnell (2008) <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00623.x>; Relative sea level rate estimation incorporating time uncertainty in polynomial regression models (Parnell and Gehrels 2015) <DOI:10.1002/9781118452547.ch32>; non-parametric phase modelling via Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine the activity of a site (and as an alternative to the 'Oxcal' function SUM(); currently unpublished), and reverse calibration of dates from calibrated into 14C years (also unpublished).
