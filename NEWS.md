# Bchron 4.7.3

  - Fixed a weird bug where some hdrs were coming out sort the wrong way in plot.Bchronology
  - Add the ability to create OxCal style plots with the calibration curve
  - Added a feature to plot individual dates in plot.BchronCalibratedDates

# Bchron 4.7.2

  - Included intcal20, shcal20, and marine20 new calibration curves

# Bchron 4.7.1

  - Fixed a bug in Bchronology that caused incorrect predictions

# Bchron 4.7.0

  - Fixed a(nother) small bug in predict.Bchronologies
  - Included proper testthat, travis, and code coverage

# Bchron 4.6.1

  - Fixed bug in predict.Bchronologies

# Bchron 4.6 

Fixed two important bugs:

  - Fixed a mistake in BchronCalibrate that will cause calibrated to have incorrect error ranges compared to OxCal
  - Fixed a problem that occurred in very straight chronologies where a certain parameter would go to zero and cause numerical underflow

# Bchron 4.5

  - Fixed some minor issues with ggplots
  - Added in code for scaling the x-axis

# Bchron 4.4

  - Changed plots to use ggplot2 via ggridges

# Bchron 4.3

Added some new functions:

  - dateInfluence, which works out how influential a single date is in a core
  - coreInfluence, which tries to estimate the total uncertainty reduction/increase between two Bchronology runs
  - choosePositions, which suggest new positions/depths to date to maximally reduce uncertainty
