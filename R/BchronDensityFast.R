#' Non-parametric phase model (faster version)
#'
#' This function runs a non-parametric phase model on 14C and non-14C ages via Gaussian Mixture density estimation through the mclust package
#'
#' @param ages A vector of ages (most likely 14C)
#' @param ageSds A vector of 1-sigma values for the ages given above
#' @param calCurves A vector of values containing either \code{intcal20}, \code{shcal20}, \code{marine20}, or \code{normal} (older calibration curves such as intcal13 are also supported). Should be the same length the number of ages supplied. Non-standard calibration curves can be used provided they are supplied in the same format as those previously mentioned and are placed in the same directory. Normal indicates a normally-distributed (non-14C) age.
#' @param pathToCalCurves File path to where the calibration curves are located. Defaults to the system directory where the 3 standard calibration curves are stored. 
#' @param dfs Degrees-of-freedom values for the t-distribution associated with the calibration calculation. A large value indicates Gaussian distributions assumed for the 14C ages
#' @param samples Number of samples of calibrated dates required
#' @param G Number of Gaussian mixture components
#'
#' @details This is a faster approximate version of \code{\link{BchronDensity}} that uses the \code{\link{densityMclust}} function to compute the Gaussian mixtures for a set of calibrated ages. The method is an approximation as it does not fit a fully Bayesian model as \code{\link{BchronDensity}} does. It is designed to be a probabilistic version of the Oxcal SUM command which takes calibrated ages and sums the probability distributions with the aim of estimating activity through age as a proxy.
