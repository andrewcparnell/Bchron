## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.5.0
* GitHub Actions
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs on GitHub Actions or win-builder

On my local machine I got a note aobut being unable to verify the time but I don't think I can fix this. 

Many thanks for your continuing important work with R,

Andrew
