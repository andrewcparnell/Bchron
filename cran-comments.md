## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.5
* GitHub Actions
* rhub
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I ran into problems installing revdepcheck on my latest machine but have run it previously and never had any issues with the two downstream dependencies

Many thanks for your continuing important work with R,

Andrew
