## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.1.0
* GitHub Actions
* rhub
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs on my local machine, GitHub Actions, or win-builder.

I had some problems with some of the Rhub builds. It reported a success but gave 'Error: No such container: Bchron_4.7.6.tar.gz-f42c1d5fcd524be2a99f4ebde3c43d55-1' associated with Docker. I wasn't sure how to fix this. 

Many thanks for your continuing important work with R,

Andrew
