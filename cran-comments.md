## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.5.0
* GitHub Actions
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs on any of the above

On my local machine I got a NOTE about being unable to verify the time but I don't think I can fix this. 

On win-builder I got a NOTE about some possibly mis-spelled words which aren't mis-spelled, and a NOTE about a broken web link which works fine for me.

Many thanks for your continuing important work with R,

Andrew
